\section{Related Surveys}
\label{sec:related}
Federated learning has become a buzzword in various fields, leading to the emergence of numerous FL studies.
These works can be classified into three primary categories: FL systems design, FL applications and FL toolkits. %Extensive surveys are devoted to summarizing the advancement of federated learning, as shown in Appendix I.
The initial architectures and concepts for FL systems were summaried by Yang \textit{et al.}~\cite{yang2019federated}. 
They categorized FL into horizontal FL, vertical FL and federated transfer learning based on the distribution characteristics of data, 
which are written in IEEE Standard 3652.1-2020~\cite{yang2021white, IEEEstd3652}. 
Following this, several surveys have emerged with a focus on enhancing FL system~\cite{li2020federated,aledhari2020federated, kairouz2021advances, zhang2021survey, li2021survey}. 
From the algorithmic perspective, personlized FL~\cite{kulkarni2020survey, tan2022towards} aims to learn personlized models for each client to address the challenge of statistical heterogeneity~\cite{ma2022state}.
Meanwhile, the privacy-perserving computing platforms and model aggregation protocols for FL also been widely studied and summarized by~\cite{liu2022privacy,el2022differential,yin2021comprehensive,lyu2020threats}.
Furthermore, many advanced FL architectures had been proposed, such as asynchronous~\cite{xu2023asynchronous}, decentralized and blockchain-based FL frameworks~\cite{nguyen2021federated, qu2022blockchain, zhu2022blockchain}.
%Given that federated learning technologies enable collaboration among distributed participants in model training and decision-making, this capability holds great promise in a wide range of application scenarios.
%For instance, multiple geogrphically distributed medical insitutions can enhace medication recommendation, drug-drug interaction prediction and medical image analysis in a collaborative manner without exchanging any sensitive data~\cite{xu2021federated, pfitzner2021federated, antunes2022federated, rieke2020future}. 
%The massive real-time data generated by IoT devices in smart cities~\cite{zhang2022federated, ramu2022federated}, industries~\cite{boopalan2022fusion}, vehicles~\cite{du2020federated} has also sparked interest in exploring how FL technology can be used to deliver more advanced services such as intrusion detection, anomaly detection, fraud detection and network load prediction~\cite{agrawal2022federated, alazab2021federated, ghimire2022recent}.

Currently, most surveys extensively discuss the challenges of efficiency, heterogeneity, privacy in FL systems design, while the surveys from blockchain fields offer the most comprehensive review\textsuperscript{\ddag{I}}. 
However, except for a few blockchain-based FL studies, most of the listed surveys just present the same story from different angles and backgrounds, i.e., a server sets the model training task and delegates it to data holders to complete. 
This \textit{server-dominated} cooperation framework is a narrow implementation of FL systems.
Therefore, this survey aims to fill the gap by investigating and surveying the associated tenchnologies that support more open and inclusive cooperation frameworks in FL systems, where all entities, whether they own the data or not, can benefit from it. 

\textbf{Distinction of Our Survey}.
This survey focuses on exploring the innovative FL cooperation frameworks, which involves some FL concepts such as decentralized FL, blockchain-based FL, few-shot FL, ML related platforms and services but goes beyond them.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first survey that focuses on the \textbf{cooperation frameworks} of FL\textsuperscript{\ddag{I}}.
%We further distinguish our survey by highlingting the similarities and differences between these related concepts in Appendix I.
%, we will differentiate this survey from other related concepts in the field of FL.

TODO:
given the high scalability of modern edge computing networks, a single MEC server cannot manage to aggregate all updates offloaded from millions of devices.
Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop a more decentralized FL approach without using a central server so as to solve security and scalability issues for enabling the next generation intelligent edge networks.
